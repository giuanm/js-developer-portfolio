  "aboutme": "Life explorer in search of new experiences and learning. Passionate about ballroom dance (tango, zouk, forró, and bachata), cooking, traveling, making new friends, and dedicated to always learning and discovering something new. Currently living in Malta until February 2024. Graduated in Statistics and Applied Mathematics, Analysis and Systems Development. 2023 was the year I took to live a new phase, traveling to many places, learning English, meeting many people, and being able to share experiences/culture. I believe in the power of positivity and continuous personal growth, love to put into practice what I learn from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). Always in search of challenges and opportunities to learn and evolve.",
  "desPersonality1": "Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.",
  "desPersonality2": "While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.",
